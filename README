An efficient integer multiplier generator. This program can generate these multipliers:
- Stand-alone (a simple multiplier with partial product generation, summation tree and a final stage adder)
- Merged Multipliers (merges four smaller stand-alone multipliers to attain the same functionality)
- Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
- Dot Multiply
with these summation tree algorithms:
- Wallace Tree
- Dadda Tree
with these partial products (signed or unsigned):
- Simple 
- Booth radix-2
- Booth radix-4
and with these final stage adders:
- Ladner-Fisher
- Kogge-Stone
- Han-Carlson
- Ripple-Carry

You can use these generator as follows:

1. make
2. ./multgen
3. Follow the instructions to create the integer multiplier of your choice!

Generated multiplier can be verified in ACL2 following the method published in:

Note that some features are  still in development and generated multipliers
might be incorrect. For example, we have found some buggy designs generated
with the "Merged Multipliers" option.
