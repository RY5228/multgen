An efficient integer multiplier generator. This version can generate these multipliers:
- Stand-alone (a simple multiplier with partial product generation, summation tree and a final stage adder)
- Merged Multipliers (merges four smaller stand-alone multipliers to attain the same functionality)
- Fused Multiply-add
with these summation tree algorithms:
- Wallace Tree
- Dadda Tree
with these partial products:
- Simple Signed
- Simple Unsigned
- Signed Booth radix-2
- Unsigned Booth radix-2
- Signed Booth radix-4
- Unsigned Booth radix-4
and with these final stage adders:
- Ladner-Fisher
- Kogge-Stone
- Han-Carlson
- Ripple-Carry

You can use these generator as follows:

1. make
2. ./multgen
3. Follow the instructions to create the integer multiplier of your choice!

Generated multiplier can be verified in ACL2 following the method published in:
