An efficient integer multiplier generator, outputting Verilog modules. This program can generate these multipliers:
- Stand-alone (a simple multiplier with partial product generation, summation tree and a final stage adder)
- Merged Multipliers (merges four smaller stand-alone multipliers to attain the same functionality)
- Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
- Dot Multiply
with these summation tree algorithms:
- Wallace Tree
- Dadda Tree
with these partial products (signed or unsigned):
- Simple 
- Booth radix-2
- Booth radix-4
- Booth radix-8
- Booth radix-16
and with these final stage adders:
- Brent-Kung
- Ladner-Fisher
- Kogge-Stone
- Han-Carlson
- J. Sklansky Conditional
- Ripple-Carry

You can use these generator as follows:

1. make
2. ./multgen
3. Follow the instructions to create the integer multiplier of your choice!

To see all available options, run:
./multgen -help

The generator will also generate  a module with the design's specification.
This extra  module's output  signal "design_is_correct"  becomes 1  iff the
design computes  the correct  result. This can  help verify  designs easily
without having the user manually define the spec.  Example output files are
given in the "examples" directory.

Generated multiplier can be verified in ACL2 following the method published in:

Beware  that this generator itself is not verified and it is  not  guaranteed  for 
all possible  configurations  to generate functionally correct  designs. You can 
follow our  paper and use our tool on ACL2 to make  sure that you have correct
designs. Some demo files for verification are given here:
